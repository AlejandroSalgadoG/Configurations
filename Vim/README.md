# Vim
Commands and configurations for vim

To use these files just copy vimrc to the home directory and rename to .vimrc (don't forget the dot). Then, in order to use the W command you 
have to create a file called .bash_aliases (don't forget the dot) in the home directory and copy the function run (this function is implemented
on the vimrc file) into the file (.bash_aliases).
